## Overview

[maimai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimai_(video_game)) is an arcade rhythm game developed by Sega, recognized for its unique circular playfield and physical outer-button layout. It belongs to the **Performai** series of arcade games alongside CHUNITHM and O.N.G.E.K.I.

The cabinetâ€™s input system includes:

- A large 1:1 touchscreen within a circular frame â€” present in maimai DX and later models (earlier models lack a touchscreen)
- 8 physical buttons arranged radially around the screen
- A proprietary, polled serial protocol communicated over USB-to-RS232 adapters

Each cabinet typically includes **two full input sets** (touchscreen + 8 buttons), configured for simultaneous two-player gameplay.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** maimai cabinets are usually set up with an extended multi-display configuration under Windows, with each player's screen rendered as a separate display output.

Backflow aims to provide a **modern userspace driver** for maimai controllers and cabinets, enabling input mapping and remapping on Linux without relying on closed-source Windows drivers or SegaTools patches.
